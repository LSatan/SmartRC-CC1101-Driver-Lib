Attention! in version 2.5.7 there are changes for the internal transfer functions regarding the gdo pin assignment!

---------------------------------------------
Announcements / other
---------------------------------------------

attention: currently i can only answer questions very belatedly.
try to scour existing problems for a solution if possible.
Problems that have not yet been closed are mostly already solved!
thanks for your understanding

For debug and advanced functions: https://github.com/LSatan/CC1101-Debug-Service-Tool

new library Simu_Remote: https://github.com/LSatan/Simu_Remote_CC1101

---------------------------------------------
Install:
---------------------------------------------

Can be downloaded directly from the Arduino library manager. Just search for cc1101.

---------------------------------------------
Foreword:
---------------------------------------------
First of all, thanks to Elechouse that I can make the modified library accessible to everyone.

Link: http://www.elechouse.com/elechouse/



The library has been redesigned and some improvements have been made.

Among other things, you can now also use the internal send / receive function.

I would be happy to receive your suggestions for further examples from other libraries.

All examples included are listed in the next field.

5.ESPiLight:
-
<p>Description:This Arduino library is a port of the pilight 433.92MHz protocols to the Arduino platform. It was tested with a ESP8266. The aim is to transmit, receive and parse many 433.92MHz protocols, by providing a simple Arduino friendly API. This should help to implement IoT bridges between the 434MHz-RF band and internet protocols.</p>

---------------------------------------------
Instructions / Description:
---------------------------------------------
This driver library can be used for many libraries that use a simple RF ASK module,
with the advantages of the cc1101 module.It offers many direct setting options as in 
SmartRF Studio and calculates settings such as MHz directly.

The most important functions at a glance:

``` cpp
ELECHOUSE_cc1101.Init();		//Initialize the cc1101. Must be set first!

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.setPA(PA);		//Set transmission power.

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.setMHZ(MHZ);		//Set the basic frequency.

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.SetTx();		//Set transmit on. 

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.SetTx(MHZ);		//Sets transmit on and changes the frequency.

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.SetRX();		//Set receive on.

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.SetRx(MHZ);		//Sets receive on and changes the frequency.

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.setRxBW(RXBW);		//Set Receive filter bandwidth		

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.setGDO(GDO0, GDO2); 	//Set Gdo0 (tx) and Gdo2 (rx) for serial transmission function.

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.setSpiPin(SCK, MISO, MOSI, CSN); //custom SPI pins. Set your own Spi Pins.Or to switch between multiple cc1101. Must be set before init and before changing the cc1101.

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.setChannel(chnl); 	//Set Channel from 0 to 255. default = 0(basic frequency).

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.setClb(fband, cal1, cal2); //Optionally enter Offset Callibration. Requirements: Sketch Calibrate_frequency.ino below [CC1101-Debug-Service-Tool](https://github.com/LSatan/CC1101-Debug-Service-Tool/tree/master/Calibrate_frequency).A SDR receiver and SDR software.
```
New in V2.5.7

``` cpp
ELECHOUSE_cc1101.setGDO0(GDO0);         //Sets Gdo0 for internal transfer function.

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.addGDO0(GDO0, Modul);	//Adds Gdo0 for internal transfer function (multiple cc1101).

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.addGDO(GDO0, GDO2, Modul);  //Adds Gdo0 (tx) and Gdo2 (rx) for serial transmission function (multiple cc1101).

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.addSpiPin(SCK, MISO, MOSI, CSN, Modul);  //Adds Spi Pins for multiple cc1101.

ELECHOUSE_cc1101.setModul(Modul);  //Switches between modules. from 0 to 5. So a maximum of 6.
```

The new features are not final and can be changed at any time.

All can also be used in a loop and are applied directly.

---------------------------------------------
Wiring:
---------------------------------------------

Notes: A logic level converter is recommended for arduino. It also works well without. Use at your own risk.
